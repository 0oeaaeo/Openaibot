LLMBot is a message queue based IM Bot developed around the concept of an intelligent robot assistant that can be loaded
with plugins to perform many functions. Implemented with Openai's new Feature `gpt-function-call`
support.

| Demo                              | 
|-----------------------------------|
| ![sticker](./docs/chain_chat.gif) |

Unlike previous projects, this project tries to replicate ChatGpt's plugin system based on the messaging platform,
implementing some or more features.

> Because func call is a feature, it only supports Openai type api, and does not intend to support LLM without func
> call.

## 📦 Feature

- 🍪 Call a number of pre-defined functions in natural language, use `pip` install every plugin you need.
- 📝 Messaging system, define send receivers and data can be delivered to the llm chain.
- 📎 Subscription system, which can subscribe to multiple senders in addition to paired senders, with push functionality.
- 📦 Non-question-and-answer binding, unlimited time and unlimited sender triggered response.
- 📬 Customizable ApiKey and Endpoint, traceability of sender authentication info.
- 🍾 Easy Interactive Experience.
- 🍖 Continuous session design for function plug-ins, blacklist design
- 🍟 Support for plug-in human-in-the-loop authentication, support for plug-in atomic singleton configuration, support
  for development of pre-message text validation Hooks, support for development of text<->media converters, support for
  error disabling Hooks

### 🧀 Introduction to authentication system

The authentication system we use is called `Service Provider`, which is the service provider. Its role is to assign
Endpoint/Key/Model to each sender for authentication.
Has a `token` as a bound OpenKey. The program will call the set `Service Provider` to read the private Key/configuration
Token to obtain the authentication information.

- Private authentication: Configure Endpoint/Key/Model by yourself. Such as personal use.
- Public authentication: configure Endpoint/Key/Model globally, and authorize users to use it by issuing `Token` by
  themselves. For example, a company intranet.
- Agent authentication: Build your own authentication service and define your own rules. For example, forward proxy
  server control.
- Default authentication: Public robots can use the default Endpoint/Key/Model even if nothing is configured. For
  example, public bots.

Both the authentication component and the backend need to be implemented by yourself.
